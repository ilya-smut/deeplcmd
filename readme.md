# deeplcmd

A command line application that uses the [DeepL Translator API](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro-api) to translate text or documents into one of the supported languages. The DeepL API has a free plan that allows for up to 500,000 characters to be translated.

## Usage

The syntax for translating text is as follows:

## Installation

```

```commandline
deeplcmd -t "text to be translated" -tl "target language code" -kf "file containing deepl API key"
```

The syntax for translating a document is as follows:
